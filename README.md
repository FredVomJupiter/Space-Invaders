# Space-Invaders

A simple Space Invaders game in python using the turtle module, the pygame module and basic concepts of python coding.

The background gif I created myself. The code to play sounds with pygame mixer I added myself.
This is to ensure multiple channels for sounds are available and not cutting off or interrupting the background soundtrack/ other sound effects.

Sound files are not included due to potential copyright issues.
